## Instruction
Implementing the computer opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

Calculate the next move for the computer player using the Minimax algorithm. Since we will be using ASCII art to display the board, we will use the symbols X (for the dark player who goes first) and O (for the light player who goes second). We will operate under the assumption that the player going first is the maximizing player and the player going second is the minimizing player.

The command line allows you to select whether a player is a human player or a computer player.

## Example of compile a code program to create an executable file
```sh
$ make all
```
## Example of run program commands
```sh
$ othello <player1 type> <player2 type>

$ othello human minimax
```
